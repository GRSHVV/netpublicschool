# Face Recognition PWA (Kiosk Mode)

This project is a **Progressive Web App (PWA)** for real-time **face recognition** using the webcam.  
It supports:

- âœ… **Face detection & recognition** (with `face-api.js`)  
- âœ… **Admin Module** to register and manage users (stored locally in IndexedDB)  
- âœ… **Recognition Module** (Kiosk Mode) with:  
  - Full-screen camera  
  - Green/red bounding box overlays  
  - Sound feedback (short beep = registered, long beep = unknown)  
  - Kiosk restrictions (no ESC, F5, refresh, or right-click)  
  - Exit with **admin password** only  

Works **offline** after first load (thanks to PWA caching).
